 To run , you  
 just have node installed , and in the working directory  , 
 while open in a command prompt or a terminal , 
 run the file with node, in the command prompt using  - 

 -- node server.js   

 - That will start a server for 
 
 "./"   - for index.html    
 and  "./about"  for about.html 

this repository was creaded by Vampeyer and some ai. 

This is a bare http example server with working code ,  
usually , routes are pre defined  in a routes object ,
 but for demonstration purposes the two sites are hardcoded in if statements . 




 so that means that when running the server , if you open a browser ,  
and visit the local host address , 127.0.0.1 

or just localhost. 
it will route too  index.html


as well as going to localhost/about  , 
serves the about.html file
